      <p>
        These terms are an agreement between you and {business.legalName} (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;),
        which runs {site.name}. By creating an account or using the site, you agree to them. If you don&apos;t
        agree, please don&apos;t use {site.name}.
      </p>

      <Section title="What TaylorWorks is">
        <p>
          {site.name} is a local directory and job board that helps businesses in and around {business.location}{" "}
          find independent contractors. We are not a contractor, we don&apos;t employ the contractors listed here,
          and we are not part of any agreement a business makes with a contractor. We don&apos;t check licenses,
          insurance, references or the quality of anyone&apos;s work, and a listing is not a recommendation.

      <Section title="Your account">
        <ul>
          <li>You must be at least 18 and able to enter a contract on behalf of yourself or your business.</li>
          <li>Give accurate information and keep it up to date.</li>
          <li>Keep your password private. You&apos;re responsible for what happens under your account.</li>
          <li>Tell us right away at <ContactLink /> if you think someone else has used your account.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Businesses">
        <p>
          Business accounts are free. Describe jobs honestly. Before hiring anyone, check their license, insurance and
          references yourself. Prices, schedules, payment and the work itself are between you and the contractor.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Contractors">
        <p>
          Keep your profile accurate, including what you say about licensing and insurance. You&apos;re responsible
          for holding any license, permit or insurance your work requires, and for following the law.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Listing subscriptions">
        <ul>
          <li>
            A contractor profile appears in the public directory while it has an active listing subscription. The
            plans are {plans}, plus any sales tax that applies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Subscriptions are paid in advance each month through our payment processor, Stripe, and renew
            automatically until you cancel.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can cancel at any time from the <Link href="/billing">Listing</Link> page (Manage subscription).
            Cancelling stops future charges; your listing stays up until the end of the month you&apos;ve already
            paid for.
          </li>
          <li>
            We don&apos;t refund partial months, except where the law requires it or we charged you by mistake. If you
            think a charge is wrong, contact us at <ContactLink />.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a payment fails, your listing leaves the directory until the payment goes through.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may change prices. We&apos;ll email you at least 30 days before a new price applies to your
            subscription, so you can cancel first if you prefer.

          anything you don&apos;t have the right to share. We may remove content or suspend accounts that break

        <p>
